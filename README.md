Assoluto Fatalita Dash, based upon the Assoluto Fatalita from Ridge Racer 7.

#Design Notes

The tach is a pain to make :)

---

This dash will require you to update your gear settings (under settings -> gears) for the calculated gear (unless you're very fancy and running a sequential with a canbus output), the following works decently for me currently with a stock C64 transmission:

(1st) 123 (2nd) 83 (3rd) 60 (4th) 47 (5th) 37 (6th) 33

If you've already done this with any of my other dashes, you should be fine.
